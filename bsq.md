# Sequence Files

## Overview

Sequence files are used to define the behavior of sequences in Epic Mickey. They use the *.bsq file extension and are referenced by [scenes](./scenes). Sequence files are also sometimes referred to as "cutscene files" or "BSQ files".

They have many "subsequences" that contain elements which have different behaviors, almost like commands. These elements can do things like open a dialog box, play a sound, ask a question, execute a Lua snippet, and more.

## Editing

There are currently no tools available for editing sequence files. However, research is ongoing to reverse-engineer the format.
