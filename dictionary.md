# Dictionary Files

## Overview

Dictionary files contain the text for dialog boxes, subtitles, and UI elements in Epic Mickey. They use the *.dct file extension and are referenced by [sequences](./bsq). Dictionary files are also sometimes referred to as "dialog files".

## Editing

### [BlueThinner Lite](./tools/bluethinner-lite)

Open the packfile for the desired language in BlueThinner Lite and open the *.dct file it contains. The dialog file will be displayed in the editor in XML format. You can edit the dialog's contents and save the changes back to the packfile.
