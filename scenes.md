# Scene Files

## Overview

Scenes contain a collection of entities, components for said entities, and properties for said components. They use the *.bin file extension, though are also sometimes referred to with the *.gsa extension. They are referenced by [levels](levels). Scenes can be loaded directly by the game or loaded through a level file. The game's launcher is capable of loading scenes directly without a corresponding level file as long as the scene has a player character placed in it.

## Editing

### [BlueThinner Lite](./tools/bluethinner-lite)

Simply open a packfile that contains a scene and select it in the file list. The scene will be displayed in the editor in the JSON format. You can edit the scene's properties and save the changes back to the packfile.
