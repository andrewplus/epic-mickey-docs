# Privacy Policy

The Epic Mickey Wiki takes privacy very seriously. This page outlines what data is collected by various Epic Mickey Wiki-related projects and how it is used. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact [RampantLeaf](http://discord.com/users/188015139272785920).

## [Epic Mickey Wiki](https://epicmickey.fandom.com) and [Epic Mickey: World of Inspiration Wiki](https://epic-mickey-world-of-inspiration.fandom.com)

The main wiki and the fanon wiki are subject to [Fandom's privacy policy](https://www.fandom.com/privacy-policy). Some broad usage statistics are provided to the wiki administrators, but none of it is personally identifiable or tied to your account. No wiki staff member will ever ask you to provide personal information.

## [Epic Mickey Docs](https://docs.epicmickey.wiki)

Epic Mickey Docs (this website) does not use any analytics or tracking software and no visitor information is recorded or sent to administrators. The source code can be accessed [here](https://github.com/andrewplus/epic-mickey-docs).

## Gremlin Gus Discord Bot

The Gremlin Gus bot reads all Discord messages sent in channels that it has access to for the purpose of looking for valid commands, but no messages except for bot commands are logged.

When a command is triggered, the following information may be logged for debugging purposes:

* The contents of the message that triggered the command
* The ID of the server the command was triggered in
* The date that the command was sent
* The bot's response to the command.

None of this information is used to personally identify users. The source code of the bot can be accessed [here](https://github.com/andrewplus/gusbot).
